Western High Atlas:
Elevation: 4090m
Location: Morocco

Wikipedia page found for High Atlas context. (Western, Central, and Eastern High Atlas)
Coordinates: 31°03′43″N 7°54′58″W
Wikipedia elevation: 4167m (cause of difference?)
Range serves as weather system barrier separating the Sahara from the Mediterranean and continental zones
(perhaps quite different climates on North/ South side of range and therefore different ecosystems)
Snow fall is present regularly at high elevations, mostly on Northern faces of the range.

Climate present:
Oceanic climate for N and S of Western (and N of Central) (why exposition rather than exposure)
Relatively humid with occassional torrential precipitation (annual rainfall between 600mm and 1000mm)
Existence of pine, oak and cedar forests
Forests declining due to reduction of annual precipitation, over-exploitation of trees and sheep-goat overgrazing

Some climate info and potentially evidence of forest ecosystems? (insufficient citations so info source unclear)
Article found looking into 'Tectonic Evolution of the Western High Atlas...', but doesn't seem like this relates to potential ecosystem classification.

Google scholar search results:

Intensive cropping on irrigated terraces and raising livestock (mainly sheep and goats) are main land-use types (does this allow for some info on ecosystem typology, ie. unlikely that Rosettes as main vegetation source could support livestock?) 
'destabilization processes have begun to disturb the equilibrium of the mountain ecosystem... degradatin of the natural vegetation'

Irrigated terrace agriculture , sheep and goat grazing present
Also charcoal production
'Field visits in 1998 to establish condition of irrigated terrace and runoff agriculture'- maybe can find photos from these field visits?
'Forest, though still widespread, is now less common than formerly, and is often in a badly degraded state. Tree cover includes: domesticated olives to 1400m, oaks below 2000m, junipers between 1200 and 2500m and cypress, fir and pines between 1600m and 2500m. Scattered Juniperus thurifera and stunted Q. rotundifolia grow to ~2500m and xerophytes are common to 3300m. South facing slopes have trees growing 800m higher altitude than northern hillsides...
Seems like vegetation suggests that T6.5 may be present above ~2500m
