Western High Atlas:
Elevation: 4090m
Location: Morocco

Wikipedia page found for High Atlas context. (Western, Central, and Eastern High Atlas)
Coordinates: 31°03′43″N 7°54′58″W
Wikipedia elevation: 4167m (cause of difference?)
Range serves as weather system barrier separating the Sahara from the Mediterranean and continental zones
(perhaps quite different climates on North/ South side of range and therefore different ecosystems)
Snow fall is present regularly at high elevations, mostly on Northern faces of the range.

Climate present:
Oceanic climate for N and S of Western (and N of Central) (why exposition rather than exposure)
Relatively humid with occassional torrential precipitation (annual rainfall between 600mm and 1000mm)
Existence of pine, oak and cedar forests
Forests declining due to reduction of annual precipitation, over-exploitation of trees and sheep-goat overgrazing

Some climate info and potentially evidence of forest ecosystems? (insufficient citations so info source unclear)
Article found looking into 'Tectonic Evolution of the Western High Atlas...', but doesn't seem like this relates to potential ecosystem classification.
