## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. 

## Use sections and subsections wisely

They help to organise the content and you can use the Outline to navigate the document.

## Load packages

Load the libraries or packages that you need at the beginning of the document. We use some options to supress the output of these lines of code.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(DT)
```


## Read table

You can read the `csv` files in R and then show them as tables:

```{r}
mountain_classification <- read_csv("tables/mountain classification summary.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)
datatable(mountain_classification,
          caption = 'Table 1: This is a simple caption for the table.',
          options = list(pageLength = 15, autoWidth = TRUE))
```

And we can group and summarise the data:

```{r}
mountain_classification %>% 
  group_by(Region) %>%
  summarise(`Nr of ranges` = n_distinct(Range)) %>%
  datatable(caption = 'Table 2: Summary of ranges reviewed.',
          options = list(dom = "t"))
```


We can populate another table with the list of references and we can do similar summaries of nr of references per mountain range:

```{r}
mountain_references <- read_csv("tables/references-per-mountain.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)
datatable(mountain_references)
```


## List of references

This document includes a link to a bibliography file in the front matter and will add a section called `References` at the end of the document with all entries included in the bibliography file. 

It is also possible to cite specific references using the reference key [@finch2009late].
