Observation and analysis show that forest facies are not correlated with soil, but depend essentially on anthropic activities.

It has a rich biological diversity, characterised by numerous different ecosystems, habitats, and species, especially mammals. In this area, there were the last observations of several carnivore species in Morocco as the case of the Barbary lion (1942), the panther (1983), and the striped hyena (2022). The mountain ecosystems of the CHA are strategic for Morocco because of their various socioeconomic and ecological roles. Mammals have important roles in the food webs of practically every ecosystem. The removal of mammal species can have major impacts on ecological communities, destabilizing ecosystems and their food webs. Consequently, extinction and decline of mammals of the CHA have negative impacts on local ecosystems and on national economy. Our previous studies indicated that biodiversity has been declining in this area at an alarming rate in recent years. This article summarizes data collected and published by the author et al. on mammal diversity in the CHA Mountains during the two last decades (2003-2023). In addition, new data were recorded and reported here. Data on mammal species and ecosystems were collected on different aspects of mammalian ecology, especially distribution and population status; anthropogenic impact on habitats and species; illegal capture, killing and trade of mammals; effects of tourism activities on ecology and ethology of mammals; human-mammals conflict; ecological and economic consequences of biodiversity loss; and the main actions and ways to preserve biodiversity and ecosystems in the CHA.},

abstract="Ti-n HanakatenTi-n Hanakatenis one of the most important prehistoric sites of the Tassili n'Ajjer, in the Algerian Sahara. Since the Early HoloceneHolocene, and during the Middle and Late HoloceneHolocene, the occupants of Ti-n HanakatenTi-n Hanakatenwere hunter-gatherers, and then herders of the Bovidian culture (Aumassip et al. 2013). The HoloceneHolocenestratigraphical sequence of this site consists of preserved archaeological layers with evidence of a long cultural occupation between approximately 8250{\thinspace} and 660 BC. During six field excavations (1974, 1975, 1976, 1978, 1980 and 1981) directed by G. Aumassip, a very large quantity of botanical remains was uncovered from the archaeological deposits of Ti-n HanakatenTi-n Hanakaten. The archaeobotanical study of this site included palynological and anthracological analyses, and offered interesting palaeoenvironmental information on a fairly unknown area. PollenPollendata provide a broad view of the vegetation that characterized the immediate as well as the more distant surroundings of the site during the HoloceneHolocene. The pollenPollenflora of Ti-n HanakatenTi-n Hanakatenbelongs to different phytogeographical groups and points to the presence of a mosaic of vegetation types. Probably Mediterranean vegetation grew at 1000 m elevation during HoloceneHolocenetimes when climatic and ecological conditions were favorable for Cupressus (C. dupreziana), Pistacia (P. atlantica) and Olea (O. laperrinei). The study of charcoalCharcoalremains was useful to infer human activities and plant exploitation at the site, documenting woody plants used for fuel or other purposes. Probably small groups of inhabitants visited diverse territories in order to find wood or charcoalCharcoal, and some resources may have been transported to the site from distant regions, for instance from the highest elevations of the Tassili n'Ajjer mountains where the aforementioned Mediterranean vegetation was likely found.",

abstract="The aim of this study was to highlight the impact of climate change on the spatial distribution of Cedrus atlantica forests in the Belezma National Park (BNP) in Algeria. Maximum entropy (MaxEnt) species distribution modeling approach combined with 19 climatic, 15 soil-related and 15 topographical factors were implemented here for the spatial distribution of Cedrus atlantica. The future predictions of both horizons 2050 and 2070 (CCSM4 model) were carried out to understand the future suitable range of the species. Results showed that the model MaxEnt was efficient and revealed significantly higher measurement of the AUC value (Area Under Curve) compared to the random prediction. AUC was 0.986 for training and 0.980 for the test data. The response curves of species occurrence vs. environmental variables showed that climatic variables have the most significant contributions compared to edaphic and topographic factors. A very high decrease in suitable area of C. atlantica was forecast on the basis of our predictions for 2070. This indicates that the species has a little chance to survive under the conditions of the future climate change scenarios. Our findings incite us to call for urgent actions in order to reduce the vulnerability of this species' habitats in front of climate change.",

Using satellite imagery, broad habitat units were mapped, and plant species lists were compiled for these units, based on local, national and regional distribution data, published information and targeted field work. Formal protection, red-list status, and an index of rarity based on distribution range and endemism were used to determine a rating for species of conservation importance. These ratings were summed per landscape unit, providing an overall rating for each unit. The topographically heterogeneous landscape in a transitional area between southern Africa’s winter and summer rainfall regimes was delineated in 32 landscape units. A total of 835 plant species was included in this study, 265 of which were defined as having particular conservation importance. The systematic incorporation of level of endemism and an index of rarity based on range size, facilitated a fully objective process of biodiversity zoning. The resulting zoning presents a relative measure of prioritisation for conservation, sufficiently flexible to be adapted to the species richness and data range in a particular study area and is therefore site-specific. Although a large part of the study area is formally protected in state-protected areas and adjoining private nature reserves, nearly 50% of the most important area in the western Succulent Karoo section of the landscape is on private farmland and townlands of the mining town Rosh Pinah with no formal protection. Also, exploration and small-scale mining take place along the Orange River. All these factors pose a threat to some of the rarer plants.&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;}, journal={Namibian Journal of Environment}, author={Burke, A}, year={2017}, month={Dec.}, pages={Section A, 60–71} }

      The Major Megetation Types (MVT) and plant communities of the Soutpansberg Centre of Endemism are described in detail, with special reference to the Soutpansberg Conservancy and the Blouberg
      Nature Reserve. Phytosociological data from 442 sample plots were ordinated using a DEtrended CORrespondence ANAlysis (DECORANA) and classified using TWo-Way INdicator SPecies ANalysis
      (TWINSPAN). The resulting classification was further refined with table-sorting procedures based on the Braun-Blanquet floristic-sociological approach of vegetation classification using
      MEGATAB. Eight MVT's were identified and described as Eragrostis lehmanniana var. lehmanniana-Sclerocarya birrea subsp. caffra Blouberg Northern Plains Bushveld, Euclea divinorum-Acacia

      The Soutpansberg Geomorphic Province, as defined by Partridge et al. (2010), incorporates three distinct orographic features, namely Soutpansberg, Blouberg and Makgabeng. These three orographic
      features are so different in their 'gestalt' and drainage evolution that it only is a logical step to describe them as separate geomorphic provinces. As a result of their distinctive
      geomorphological setting these three regions also support a unique phytogeographic assemblage. This paper redefines the Soutpansberg Geomorphic Province, limiting its extent to Soutpansberg
      sensu stricto, and then defines two additional geomorphic provinces, namely Blouberg and Makgabeng.

Mulanje, 69 species were identified that apparently only occurred on the massif; others had local or slightly wider but disjunct distributions. These are compared with a list of 30 species endemic to Mt. Mulanje produced by Wild in 1964. The endemic species represent 5.3% of the naturally occurring and naturalised flora. Mt. Mulanje has been identified as one of the sites in Africa in greatest need of protection and as a Centre of Plant Diversity. It is hoped that the information presented here will be of practical use for the conservation and management plans being proposed for Mt. Mulanje.},
