- Specifics to look for (currently looking for particular climate and flora relating to Tropical alpine grasslands and herblands)
A: soil as well, transformed?
- How much context if any is helpful (ie. found context of weather systems on either side of Atlas mountains and many references to overgrazing leading to degradation and therefore difficulty in recognising the ecosystem, potential field visit photos from 1998?)
A: can be useful for step 2
- How much value in photos?
A: Highly valuable if contextual
- Is my goal to find the answer or recognise the nuance?
A: bit of both ofc but basically find the answer
- Translation of papers?
A: as long as it is recognised and helps understanding
- At what point should I make a decision and move on (Yes, No or too hard to tell)
A: pretty quickly, lots to get through and step 1 is just finding options
- Understanding exactly where the mountains are geographically and map out where info is collected from or is that too complex?
A: for large mountain ranges, general info is usually better, but for the smaller ones, individual peaks are valuable info
