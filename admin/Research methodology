Research methodology

1. google search for background/ context
2. google scholar searches for:
'[mountain name] Ecosystems'
'[mountain name] flora and fauna'
'[mountain name] climate'

eg.
'High Atlas mountains' - context/ general papers with accessory info
'Western High Atlas Ecosystems' - direct
'Western High Atlas flora and fauna' - specific
'Western High Atlas climate' - specific

3. The information present for the range is added to the table: 'mountain classification summary', separating into categories

4. Each reference is added to the table: references-per-mountain, specifying the region, range, and search term used to find the source
