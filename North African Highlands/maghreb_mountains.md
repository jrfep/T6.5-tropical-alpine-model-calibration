# Maghreb Mountains research
(2000m +)


## steps taken:

1. check for wiki link on app
2. google search for background/ context
3. google scholar and BASE searches for:
'high atlas mountains' - context/ general papers with accessory info
'Western High Atlas Ecosystems' - direct
'Western High Atlas Ecosystem typology'
'Western High Atlas flora and fauna' - specific
'western high atlas climate' - specific
use names of peaks as well

 

 
## Western High Atlas:
**Elevation (m)**: 4090
**Location**: Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia

Wikipedia page found for High Atlas context. (Western, Central, and Eastern High Atlas)
Coordinates: 31°03′43″N 7°54′58″W
Wikipedia elevation: 4167m (cause of difference?)
Range serves as weather system barrier separating the Sahara from the Mediterranean and continental zones
(perhaps quite different climates on North/ South side of range and therefore different ecosystems)
Snow fall is present regularly at high elevations, mostly on Northern faces of the range.

Climate present:
Oceanic climate for N and S of Western (and N of Central) (why exposition rather than exposure)
Relatively humid with occassional torrential precipitation (annual rainfall between 600mm and 1000mm)
Existence of pine, oak and cedar forests
Forests declining due to reduction of annual precipitation, over-exploitation of trees and sheep/goat overgrazing

Some climate info and potentially evidence of forest ecosystems? (insufficient citations so info source unclear)
Article found looking into 'Tectonic Evolution of the Western High Atlas...', but doesn't seem like this relates to potential ecosystem classification.

Google scholar search results:

Intensive cropping on irrigated terraces and raising livestock (mainly sheep and goats) are main land-use types (does this 
allow for some info on ecosystem typology, ie. unlikely that Rosettes as main vegetation source could support livestock?) 
'destabilization processes have begun to disturb the equilibrium of the mountain ecosystem... degradation of the natural 
vegetation'

Science Direct [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geobios.2012.05.002]


Irrigated terrace agriculture , sheep and goat grazing present
Also charcoal production
'Field visits in 1998 to establish condition of irrigated terrace and runoff agriculture'- maybe can find photos from these 
field visits?
'Forest, though still widespread, is now less common than formerly, and is often in a badly degraded state. Tree cover 
includes: domesticated olives to 1400m, oaks below 2000m, junipers between 1200 and 2500m and cypress, fir and pines 
between 1600m and 2500m. Scattered Juniperus thurifera and stunted Q. rotundifolia grow to ~2500m and xerophytes are common 
to 3300m. South facing slopes have trees growing 800m higher altitude than northern hillsides...
Seems like vegetation suggests that T6.5 may be present above ~2500m

Precipitation annually below 200mm, north and west slopes are locally more wet and agriculturally facourable
To west and north, much of land is covered with thyme, rosemary and other drought tolerant plants, eg. argan

Forest ecosystems present in Northwestern Rif
Soil genesis, classification, and nitrogen cycling in forest ecosystems of Northwestern Rif region of Morocco

abstract={Soil-related information is lacking in the forest ecosystems of the Rif region. Detailed soil descriptions, and chemical, physical, and mineralogical information are necessary for planning and management. Soils of the forested area around Chefchaouen, Morocco, were described along altitudinal gradients, and classified using soil taxonomy. Nitrogen mineralization was measured in the laboratory, using anaerobic and aerobic incubations, and in the field with trenched plots. The dominant forest species were Quercus suber, Quercus perinaica, Abies marocana, Pinus pinaster var. moghrebiana, Pinus radiata, and Cedrus atlantica. Most of the soils were shallow, unstable, and were limited in their productive capability. They were classified as Entisols, Inceptisols, Mollisols, Alfisols, and Ultisols. The main soil development processes were weathering, decalcification, melanization, mineralization, humification, rubifaction, leaching, lessivage, gleization, and erosion. There were some differences in clay minerals related to parent material. The potentially available soil nitrogen, N$\sb{\rm min}$ from anaerobic incubation and N$\sb0$ from aerobic incubation, in the survey experiment did not show significant differences among sites, because of the large within-site variability. N$\sb{\rm min}$ ranged from 22 to 87 mg-N kg$\sp{-1}$ in the mineral surface horizons and from 3 to 31 mg-N kg$\sp{-1}$ in the subsurface horizons. N$\sb0$ ranged from 48 to 143 mg-N kg$\sp{-1}$ and from 18 to 57 mg-N kg$\sp{-1}$ in the upper and lower horizons respectively. The rate constant of N mineralization (k) ranged from 0.130 to 0.253 week$\sp{-1}$ in the surface horizon and decreased significantly with depth. The values of N$\sb{\rm min}$ and N$\sb{0}$ measured in trenched plot experiment were lower than those measured in the survey experiment. N$\sb{\rm min}$ ranged from 11 to 46 mg-N kg$\sp{-1}$ and N$\sb0$ from 29 to 54 mg-N kg$\sp{-1},$ with a significant decrease with depth for both. Yearly net N mineralization measured in the field varied from 6 to 29 kg-N ha$\sp{-1}$ yr$\sp{-1}$ in the surface soil (ranging from 0-10 to 0-40 cm), and from 9 to 14 kg-N ha$\sp{-1}$ yr$\sp{-1}$ in the subsurface horizon (ranging from 10 to 70 cm). Yearly net N uptake by plants was highly correlated with net N mineralization and varied from 17 to 25 kg-N ha$\sp{-1}$ yr$\sp{-1}.$},

Based on transects made in various C. atlantica Manetti communities, the author investigates the main influences (ecological, or due to human activities) affecting existing plant communities, and examines variations in forest facies alongside modifications to the soil. Observation and analysis show that forest facies are not correlated with soil, but depend essentially on anthropic activities.
