Maghreb Mountains research
(2000m +)

Confirm with JR
- Specifics to look for (currently looking for particular climate and flora relating to Tropical alpine grasslands and herblands)
A: soil as well, transformed?
- How much context if any is helpful (ie. found context of weather systems on either side of Atlas mountains and many references to overgrazing leading to degradation and therefore difficulty in recognising the ecosystem, potential field visit photos from 1998?)
A: can be useful for step 2
- How much value in photos?
A: Highly valuable if contextual
- Is my goal to find the answer or recognise the nuance?
A: bit of both ofc but basically find the answer
- Translation of papers?
A: as long as it is recognised and helps understanding
- At what point should I make a decision and move on (Yes, No or too hard to tell)
A: pretty quickly, lots to get through and step 1 is just finding options
- Understanding exactly where the mountains are geographically and map out where info is collected from or is that too complex?
A: for large mountain ranges, general info is usually better, but for the smaller ones, individual peaks are valuable info

steps taken:
1. check for wiki link on app
2. google search for background/ context
3. google scholar and BASE searches for:
'high atlas mountains' - context/ general papers with accessory info
'Western High Atlas Ecosystems' - direct
'Western High Atlas Ecosystem typology'
'Western High Atlas flora and fauna' - specific
'western high atlas climate' - specific
use names of peaks as well

Western High Atlas:
Elevation: 4090m
Location: Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia

Wikipedia page found for High Atlas context. (Western, Central, and Eastern High Atlas)
Coordinates: 31°03′43″N 7°54′58″W
Wikipedia elevation: 4167m (cause of difference?)
Range serves as weather system barrier separating the Sahara from the Mediterranean and continental zones
(perhaps quite different climates on North/ South side of range and therefore different ecosystems)
Snow fall is present regularly at high elevations, mostly on Northern faces of the range.

Climate present:
Oceanic climate for N and S of Western (and N of Central) (why exposition rather than exposure)
Relatively humid with occassional torrential precipitation (annual rainfall between 600mm and 1000mm)
Existence of pine, oak and cedar forests
Forests declining due to reduction of annual precipitation, over-exploitation of trees and sheep/goat overgrazing

Some climate info and potentially evidence of forest ecosystems? (insufficient citations so info source unclear)
Article found looking into 'Tectonic Evolution of the Western High Atlas...', but doesn't seem like this relates to potential ecosystem classification.

Google scholar search results:

Intensive cropping on irrigated terraces and raising livestock (mainly sheep and goats) are main land-use types (does this 
allow for some info on ecosystem typology, ie. unlikely that Rosettes as main vegetation source could support livestock?) 
'destabilization processes have begun to disturb the equilibrium of the mountain ecosystem... degradation of the natural 
vegetation'
JSTOR [https://doi.org/10.2307/3673021]

Science Direct [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geobios.2012.05.002]


Irrigated terrace agriculture , sheep and goat grazing present
Also charcoal production
'Field visits in 1998 to establish condition of irrigated terrace and runoff agriculture'- maybe can find photos from these 
field visits?
'Forest, though still widespread, is now less common than formerly, and is often in a badly degraded state. Tree cover 
includes: domesticated olives to 1400m, oaks below 2000m, junipers between 1200 and 2500m and cypress, fir and pines 
between 1600m and 2500m. Scattered Juniperus thurifera and stunted Q. rotundifolia grow to ~2500m and xerophytes are common 
to 3300m. South facing slopes have trees growing 800m higher altitude than northern hillsides...
Seems like vegetation suggests that T6.5 may be present above ~2500m

Anti-Atlas:
Elevation: 3304m
Location: Morocco

Wikipedia:
North plateau is 1700-1800m
South is the Sahara highlands at ~700m
Precipitation annually below 200mm, north and west slopes are locally more wet and agriculturally facourable
To west and north, much of land is covered with thyme, rosemary and other drought tolerant plants, eg. argan
In south, little but thorn shrubs remain with gradual transition to desert.
